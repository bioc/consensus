Description: An implementation of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E691 for interlaboratory testing procedures, designed for cross-platform genomic measurements. Given three (3) or more genomic platforms or laboratory protocols, this package provides interlaboratory testing procedures giving per-locus comparisons for sensitivity and precision between platforms.
